"This project implements a comprehensive test automation framework for the OpenCart e-commerce platform. Utilizing Selenium WebDriver for browser automation and TestNG for test orchestration, the framework is designed to execute end-to-end testing scenarios, including user authentication, product catalog navigation, shopping cart operations, and order processing. Key features include data-driven testing facilitated by Apache POI for Excel integration, robust logging with Log4j, and seamless build management through Maven. The framework supports cross-browser testing and is structured to allow easy scalability and maintenance."

Technologies and Tools:

Programming Language: Java
Automation Tools: Selenium WebDriver, TestNG
Build Management: Maven
Logging: Log4j
Data Handling: Apache POI (for Excel integration)
Version Control: Git
Approach: The framework adopts a modular design pattern, promoting code reusability and ease of maintenance. Test cases are organized based on application modules, and a data-driven approach is employed to enhance test coverage by running test scripts with multiple data sets. Comprehensive logging and reporting mechanisms are integrated to facilitate efficient debugging and monitoring of test executions."
